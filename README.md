# interviewAssignment

For this assignment, I have implemented TestNG automation framework and followed Page Object Model as design pattern. I have used Maven tool for building project and required dependency. I have created seperate page classsed under pageObjects package to store the all the web elements and methods.

I have created testCases packages to group the test cases and created Baseclass under Base package. Baseclass contains prerequisite steps like launching chrome drivers also beforeclass and afterclass anotations.

You can execute the tests using testNG, the reports will be generated under test-output folder.
